# Movies-ETL
## Brief description of your project
Britta needs our help to prepare data for a hackathon. A hackathon is an event where teams of analysts collaborate to work intensively on a project, using data to solve a problem. Hackathons generally last several days, and teams work around the clock on their projects.

Britta wants to collect Wikipedia and Kaggle data, combine them and save them into a SQL database so that hackathon participants have a nice and clean dataset to use. To do this, we followed the **ETL** process: **extract** Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files,**transform** the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and **load** the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
